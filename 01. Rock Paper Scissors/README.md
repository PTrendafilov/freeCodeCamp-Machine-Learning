# RPS.py is the strategy
The given strategy is an advanced approach to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, which uses a higher-order Markov chain and variable history length to predict the opponent's next move based on their past moves. Here is an explanation of the strategy:

# Initialization
When there are less than two moves in the opponent's history, the strategy randomly selects one of Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S) and appends the opponent's latest move to the history.

# Transition matrix
A nested defaultdict is used to create a transition matrix, which records the frequency of the opponent's moves following a certain sequence of moves (history). The maximum history length is set to 3, but you can adjust this value to consider longer or shorter sequences.

# Updating the transition matrix
The strategy iterates through the opponent's move history and updates the transition matrix accordingly, considering various history lengths. The matrix keeps track of how often the opponent plays a certain move after a specific sequence of moves.

# Predicting the opponent's next move
The strategy determines the most likely next move for the opponent based on the highest-order Markov chain with non-empty probabilities. Starting from the maximum history length and moving to lower orders, the strategy checks if there is enough data in the opponent's history and if there are move probabilities recorded for the corresponding history length. The move with the highest probability is selected as the most likely next move.

# Countering the opponent's move
Based on the predicted next move for the opponent, the strategy plays the move that beats it. If the predicted move is Rock (R), the strategy plays Paper (P). If the predicted move is Paper (P), it plays Scissors (S). If the predicted move is Scissors (S), it plays Rock (R).

This strategy is adaptive and robust as it considers the opponent's move patterns and adjusts its predictions based on the highest-order Markov chain available. It offers a more effective counter to opponents with consistent patterns in their moves than simpler frequency-based strategies.
